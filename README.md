**Title:** Question Answering System with Context Retrieval

**Description:**

This project implements a question-answering chatbot system that leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs) and Pinecone for contextual retrieval. The system:

* **Embeds** PDF documents using OpenAI's text-embedding model.
* **Indexes** the embeddings in Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
* **Retrieves** relevant contexts from Pinecone based on the user's query.
* **Formulates** a prompt for the LLM that incorporates the retrieved contexts and the user's query.
* **Generates** a response using the LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo-0613) based on the formulated prompt.
* Provides a user-friendly interface using Gradio for interaction.

**Requirements:**

* OpenAI API Key ([https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/))
* Pinecone API Key ([https://www.pinecone.io/](https://www.pinecone.io/))
* Python libraries:
    * langchain
    * pinecone-client
    * openai
    * pypdf2  (for PDF parsing)
    * gradio

**Instructions:**

1. Replace the placeholder values for `op_key` and `pc_key` in the code with your own OpenAI and Pinecone API keys.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install <library_name>`.
3. Ensure you have a directory containing the PDF documents you want to process.
4. Run the script using `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with your actual script name). This will:
    * Read and split the PDF documents.
    * Create embeddings for each document page.
    * Index the embeddings in Pinecone.
    * Launch the Gradio interface for user interaction.

**Usage:**

The Gradio interface provides a text box for users to enter their questions. Submitting a question triggers the retrieval of relevant contexts, prompt generation, and response using the LLM. 



**Further Development:**

* Explore different document splitting and retrieval strategies.
* Experiment with various LLM models and fine-tuning techniques.
* Integrate additional functionalities like document summarization or knowledge base search.
